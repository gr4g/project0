Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I did my project about my past experience trading stocks on the NYSE. I included some trades that I have executed in the past, stocks that are considered "always safe" and a list of tips that I have learned. I added an extra page to ward off any people from listening to gurus like Ty Lopez (well known stock market misinformer who runs ads on YouTube).

In page1.html I talked about my recent experience with trading stocks and how much money i've made thus far. At the bottom of the page I included 3 tips to try and follow when trading stocks.

In page2.html I broke down my current profit while trading stocks (only $58). I made it in table form so that it is easy to view.

In page3.html I made 3 collums that show 3 different stocks that are considered safe to always own. Warren Buffet personally recomended these stocks as "Safe".

In page4.html I added 2 disclaimers to anyone who wants to trade stocks. Dont listen to gurus on YouTube... EVER. People like Ty Lopez spread rumors and cheap lies about the stock market, while they stand in front of their Lamborghinis to make it seem like they know what they are doing.
