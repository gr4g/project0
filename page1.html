    <h2 class="secondheading"> My experience with the stock market!</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p class="largeparagraph"> I started trading using paper money around 8 months ago on a website called
      "<a href="https://www.stockmarketgame.com" class="links">stockmarketgame.com</a>". It started off well
    ,but everytime I made a profit, I always wanted more. So I started investing larger sums at once in hopes
  of becoming virtually rich! I was doing pretty well, making around $300 per day until I had one big fail...
I put 40k into a stock that decided to split the next day. I lost 20k immediately, good thing this was virtual
money. I learned a very valuable lesson to not be greedy when it comes to money, which I should have already known
before doing this experiment. I later learned about options, to put it simply options are a way to trade futures
 in bulk without putting lots of money on the table. I've been trading options for 3 weeks now with $1000 real money!
I've made $58, and i'm proud. I plan to keep trading and maybe one day when i'm retired I'll have something to
entertain myself with.</p>
